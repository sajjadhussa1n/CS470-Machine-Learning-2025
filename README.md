## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get a local copy of the course materials:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sajjadhussa1n/CS470-Machine-Learning-2025.git
cd CS470-Machine-Learning-2025
```

## 2. Updating Course Materials Weekly

New lectures, assignments, and notebooks will be uploaded to this repository each week.  
To ensure you always have the latest materials, **pull the updated version from the main branch** regularly.

### Step 1: Open Your Local Repository

If you have already cloned the repository, open your terminal or VS Code terminal and navigate to it:

```bash
cd CS470-Machine-Learning-2025
```
### Step 2: Pull the Latest Updates

Run the following command to fetch new lecture notes, slides, notebooks, and assignments:

```bash
git pull origin main
```
This command updates your local repository with the latest content from GitHub without deleting your existing files.

### Step 3: Handling Local Changes

If you‚Äôve made edits (for example, while solving assignments) and encounter merge conflicts, you can temporarily save your local changes before pulling updates:

```bash
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop
```
